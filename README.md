# üîê Security-Scanning-Repo

This repository provides **centralized, reusable GitHub Actions workflows** for automated security testing.
It is designed to make security scanning easy and accessible for all developers in your organization‚Äîso ‚Äúno time‚Äù or ‚Äútoo difficult‚Äù is no longer an excuse.

---

## üë§ Who Is This For?

**Any developer or team who wants to add robust security scanning to their GitHub projects with minimal setup.**
All you need to do is add a small code snippet to your workflow; everything else is managed for you.

---

## üöÄ How It Works

You simply add a provided code snippet to your own repository‚Äôs GitHub Actions workflow file.
This snippet will call the relevant workflow from this repository and run the selected security scan on your code.

- **You select which scan type and tool to use** by setting parameters in your workflow snippet.
- The scanning logic, tool integrations, and updates are all handled centrally in this repository.
- **The `main` branch is always stable and production-ready.** New features and updates are tested in branches before being merged to `main`, so you always get the latest working version.

## üõ†Ô∏è Supported Scan Types & Tools

- **SAST (Static Application Security Testing):**
  - Supported tools: `semgrep`, `sonarqube` *(coming soon)*, `bearer`, `codeql`
- **IaC (Infrastructure as Code Security):**
  - Supported tool: `checkov`
- **DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing):**
  - Supported tool: `OWASP ZAP` *(coming soon)*

## üìà Results and Artifacts

- **All scan results are output in SARIF format** and are visible in your repository‚Äôs Security tab and Actions tab.
- **SARIF files** can be downloaded as artifacts.
- For custom IaC scans, you will also receive:
  - SARIF
  - JSON
  - Plain text results (from Checkov)
