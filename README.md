# 🔐 Security-Scanning-Repo

This repository provides **centralized, reusable GitHub Actions workflows** for automated security testing.
It is designed to make security scanning easy and accessible for all developers in your organization—so “no time” or “too difficult” is no longer an excuse.

---

## 👤 Who Is This For?

**Any developer or team who wants to add robust security scanning to their GitHub projects with minimal setup.**
Just add a code snippet to your workflow; this repository manages everything else.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

You simply add a provided code snippet to your own repository’s GitHub Actions workflow file.
This snippet will call the relevant workflow from this repository and run the selected security scan on your code.

- **You select which scan type and tool to use** by setting parameters in your workflow snippet.
- The scanning logic, tool integrations, and updates are all handled centrally in this repository.
- **The `main` branch is always stable and production-ready.** New features and updates are tested in branches before being merged to `main`, so you always get the latest working version.

## 🧩 Example Usage

Add one of the following blocks to your own repository’s workflow file, and customize the parameters as needed.

> **Note:**  
> - Set `SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN` and `SONAR_TOKEN` as [GitHub Actions repository secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets).  
> - Set `SONAR_HOST_URL` as a [GitHub Actions repository variable](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables).  
> - If you are not using Semgrep or SonarQube, you can leave these empty or remove them from your workflow.

### SAST scan - code to be added in your pipeline
```yaml
SAST-Scan:
  uses: marekboodt/Security-Scanning-Repo/.github/workflows/02-sast-workflow.yml@main
  with:
    scantool: semgrep # Options: [semgrep, sonarqube (work in progress), bearer, codeql]
    # language: python, javascript # (Optional) For CodeQL, comma-separated list
    project_dir: ./src
    environment: non-prod # options: prod, non-prod | non-prod: does not block pipeline on findings (continue-on-error); prod: blocks pipeline if findings are found
  secrets: # Set these as GitHub repository secrets or variables. If not using Semgrep or SonarQube, these can be left empty.
    SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN }}
    SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}
    SONAR_HOST_URL: ${{ vars.SONAR_HOST_URL }}
```
